What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The software design document keeps you organized and helps you keep track of what tasks need to be completed to fulfil the needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could have went into greater detail for my evaluation. I could have talked about server costs and licencing costs etc.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user experience needed to be as similar as possible to the original android experience. having the game function properly and the same way for every platform ensures that the user
experience is the best it can be.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
First find the needs and requirements of the client and software being developed. Then put through various iterations and tests until software works and functions effectivly and efficiently.
